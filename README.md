# Geometric Quality Assessment of Smartphone Photography
This repository contains the constructed Smartphone Camera Geometric Calibration(SCGC) dataset, which can provide quantitative geometrical information of image acquired by smartphones. 

# Dataset
We designed a 6x9 corner point checkerboard calibration plate, with each square measuring 2.54 cm per side. The SCGC dataset, consisting of 21686 photos of the checkerboard taken by 82 smartphones of 7 mainstream brands, can be downloaded at the [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zX0y93RyWlzAlZrCxu9X8A) (Code: vxrp).
